# Epic and User Stories
## What is a User Story?
- User stories, sometimes just called stories, are a series of requirements or requests from a user's perspective.
- A specific task within a wider Epic
- Format is "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [outcome].""

## What is an Epic Story?
- An Epic Story is a large body of work that is much larger in scope, usually large enough to not be completed in a single sprint.
- These are useful to cover the functionality of a product and estimating the time and budget required for these large scale features.
- Can be used when discussing with stakeholders as it is more of an overview which will be easier to understand without a technical background.
