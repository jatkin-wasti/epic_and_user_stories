# Epic and User Stories
## What is a User Story?
- User stories, sometimes just called stories, are a series of low level requirements or requests from a user's perspective.
- A specific task within a wider Epic, that can be completed in a sprint.
- Format is "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]."
- Should be accompanied by functional acceptance criteria (minimum conditions that must be met).

## What is an Epic Story?
- An Epic Story is a large body of work that is much larger in scope, usually large enough to not be completed in a single sprint.
- High level functional and non-functional requirements from a business user's perspective.
- These are useful to cover the functionality of a product and estimating the time and budget required for these large scale features.
- Can be used when discussing with stakeholders as it is more of an overview which will be easier to understand without a technical background.

## What is a Use Case?
- A Use Case is a decription of how it would be possible to accomplish the task set out in a story.
- This will cover how an 'actor' interacts with the system to get this task done.
- An actor can be a user, another application, or even a seperate system!
- A Use Case is split up into an input/action, the expected result of that interaction, and the failed response.
- An example might be the following:
INPUT/ACTION
```
Send a reply to a text message
```
EXPECTED RESULT
```
The recipient successfully recieves the reply
```
FAILED RESPONSE
```
Message sent to wrong person
The wrong message is sent to the right person
```
